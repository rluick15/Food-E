# Food-E

Find recipes, indgridients, and nutrition information with Food-E! 

This app is built off of the Spoonacular Food API and Recipe API: https://spoonacular.com/food-api

I will be using the app as a fun way to demonstrate all things Android as well as learn various new techniques. This app will be a demonstration of the MVP pattern and will include such libraries as Dagger, Refrofit, and many more! I will also adhere to Material Design principles and hopefully include many cool animations and design patterns. Please feel free to browse!
